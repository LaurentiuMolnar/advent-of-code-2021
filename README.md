# Advent of Code 2021

This repo holds the solutions to the puzzles from Advent of Code 2021. All the solutions are written in Typescript.

Each subdirectory has the code to solve the puzzle for a particular day in the `index.ts` file.

## Running the code

To run the code, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. I used version 17.3 but any version higher than or equal to 14 should work.

Install the project dependencies running `npm install` in the root of the repo.

To run the code for a particular day, run `npm start ./day-x/index.ts`, where x is the number representing the day (e.g. for day 1, `./day-1/index.ts`).
